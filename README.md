# Hello

Practice project from The Rust Programming Language, Chapter 20. The project is to make a quick multi-threaded HTTP server using only the standard library

```
cargo run
```

Connect to the server at `localhost:7878`

## Manual Testing

Sleep the server for 5 secs at `localhost:7878/sleep` to test the thread pool with multiple simultaneous requests
